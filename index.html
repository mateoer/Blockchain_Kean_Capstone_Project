	                  	<h3>What Are Cryptocurrencies?</h3>
	                  	<p>
	                  	Cryptocurrency is decentralized digital money, based on blockchain technology. You may be familiar with the most popular versions, Bitcoin and Ethereum, but there are more than 5,000 different cryptocurrencies in circulation, according to CoinLore.
						You can use crypto to buy regular goods and services, although many people invest in cryptocurrencies as they would in other assets, like stocks or precious metals. While cryptocurrency is a novel and exciting asset class, purchasing it can be risky as you must take on a fair amount of research to fully understand how each system works.
						</p>
						
						<h3>How Do They Work?</h3>
						<p>
						A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange that is digital, encrypted and decentralized. Unlike the U.S. Dollar or the Euro, there is no central authority that manages and maintains the value of a cryptocurrency. Instead, these tasks are broadly distributed among a cryptocurrency’s users via the internet.
						</p>

						<p>
						Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, first outlined in principle by Satoshi Nakamoto in a 2008 paper titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.” Nakamoto described the project as “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.”
						
						That cryptographic proof comes in the form of transactions that are verified and recorded in a form of program called a blockchain.
						</p>
						
						<h3>What Is a Blockchain?</h3>
						<p>
						A blockchain is an open, distributed ledger that records transactions in code. In practice, it’s a little like a checkbook that’s distributed across countless computers around the world. Transactions are recorded in “blocks” that are then linked together on a “chain” of previous cryptocurrency transactions. everyone who uses a cryptocurrency has their own copy of this book to create a unified transaction record. Software logs each new transaction as it happens, and every copy of the blockchain is updated simultaneously with the new information, keeping all records identical and accurate.
						To prevent fraud, each transaction is checked using one of two main validation techniques: proof of work or proof of stake.</p>

						<h2> The Top 10 Cryptocurrencies to Know in 2021<a href="#[1]">[1]</a></h2>
                        <ol>
						
	                  	<li><h3>Bitcoin (BTC) &#x20BF:</h3></li>
						<p>The oldest and largest cryptocurrency <a href="#[2]">[2]</a>, BTC was not created out of thin air. It was born in 2009 out of a variety of other innovations which previously failed to gain traction. Needless to say, the creation of anonymous founder Satoshi Nakomoto has gained significant attention since, attracting interest not only from retail investors, but also banks, financial institutions and major market participants. Is the most widely adopted cryptocurrency. Although it’s not the most technologically advanced but still it has pproximate Market Cap of over $600 billion.</p>

                        <li> <h3>Ripple (XRP) &#x2717: </h3></li>
					    <p> Created as a means of facilitating cross-border payments through the Ripple platform <a href="#[3]">[3]</a>, XRP is the third-most popular crypto asset based on market capitalization. With significant interest from traditional financial institutions, XRP has maintained a top position among the leading cryptocurrencies. Is a centralized cryptocurrency that’s geared toward taking out the high costs of inter-bank transfers. Approximate Market Cap: $13 billion Year Established: 2012 Cost Per Transaction: Nominal</p>  

						<li> <h3>Ethereum (ETH) &#926:</h3></li>
						<p>The native currency of the Ethereum blockchain <a href="#[4]">[4]</a>, ETH gained significantly in popularity during the 2017 bull market as Ethereum became the go-to platform for initial coin offerings (ICOs). Its smart contract logic and ambition to be the world computer have attracted a strong, worldwide developer community and positioned it strongly for the future. Is a relative newcomer that has risen up the ranks thanks to its superior technology and its ability to create “smart contracts.”  It has approximate Market Cap of $100 billion. </p>

						<li> <h3>Dogecoin (Doge) &#208:</h3></li>
						<p> Dogecoin (DOGE, Ð) is a cryptocurrency invented by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer <a href="#[5]">[5]</a>, who decided to create a payment system that is instant, fun, and free from traditional banking fees. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the "Doge" meme as its logo and namesake. It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community, reaching a market capitalization of US $5,382,875,000 on January 28, 2021.
						Several online exchanges offer DOGE/BTC and DOGE/LTC trading.

						Dogecoin is an altcoin with many users. Mainstream commercial applications of the currency have gained traction on internet, such as a tipping system, in which social media users tip others for providing interesting or noteworthy content.

						Trading physical, tangible items in exchange for DOGE takes place on online communities such as Reddit and Twitter, where users frequently share currency-related information.

						Dogecoin has also been used to try to sell a house,	 and has been used in the pornography and poker industries. Dogetipbot was a cryptocurrency transaction service used on popular sites like Reddit and Twitch. It allowed users to send Dogecoins to other users through commands via Reddit comments. In May 2017 Dogetipbot was discontinued and taken offline after its creator declared bankruptcy; this left many Dogetipbot users losing their coins stored in the Dogetipbot system.</p>

                        <li><h3> Binance (BNB):</h3></li>			
						<p>Binance Coin (BNB) is a cryptocurrency that can be used to trade and pay fees on the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. The Binance Exchange is the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world as of January 2018 <a href="#[6]">[6]</a>, facilitating more than 1.4 million transactions per second.Users of Binance Coin receive a discount in transaction fees on the Binance Exchange as an incentive. BNB can also be exchanged or traded for other cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc. Binance Coin was created in July 2017 and initially worked on the ethereum blockchain with the token ERC-20 before it became the native currency of Binance’s own blockchain, the Binance Chain.</p>
	
                        <li> <h3>Cardano (ADA) &#x20B3:</h3></li>
						<p>Cardano <a href="#[7]">[7]</a> is the largest third-generation cryptocurrency, and it’s packed with plenty more upside potential in 2021. Approximate Market Cap of almost $8 billion. Cardano is a cryptocurrency network and open source project that aims to run a public blockchain platform for smart contracts. Cardano's internal cryptocurrency is called Ada. The development of the project is overseen and supervised by the Cardano Foundation based in Zug, Switzerland. A proof-of-stake blockchain, Cardano and its native cryptocurrency ADA have gained increased recognition recently with a focus on provenance and banking the unbanked.</p>

                        <li><h3> Litecoin (LTC) Ł:</h3></li>
						<p>Litecoin (LTC) <a href="#[8]">[8]</a> is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software project released under the MIT/X11 license. Litecoin was an early bitcoin spinoff or altcoin, starting in October 2011. In technical details, Litecoin is nearly identical to Bitcoin. Litecoin enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Litecoin is an open source, global payment network that is fully decentralized without any central authorities. Mathematics secures the network and empowers individuals to control their own finances. Litecoin features faster transaction confirmation times and improved storage efficiency than the leading math-based currency. With substantial industry support, trade volume and liquidity, Litecoin is a proven medium of commerce complementary to Bitcoin.</p>
		
                        <li> <h3> Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Ƀ:	</h3></li>
						<p>
						Bitcoin Cash is a cryptocurrency that is a fork of Bitcoin <a href="#[9]">[9]</a>. Bitcoin Cash is a spin-off or altcoin that was created in 2017. In November 2018, Bitcoin Cash split into two cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV. Approximate Market Cap of almost $8 billion.  Bitcoin Cash was started by bitcoin miners and developers equally concerned with the future of the cryptocurrency and its ability to scale effectively.
						In 2018, the maximum block size for BCH was increased 4x to 32MB, but actual block sizes on Bitcoin cash have remained only a small fraction of the 32MB limit.
						Bitcoin Cash is thus able to process transactions more quickly than the Bitcoin network, meaning that wait times are shorter and transaction processing fees tend to be lower. The Bitcoin Cash network can handle many more transactions per second than the Bitcoin network can. However, with the faster transaction verification time comes downsides as well. One potential issue with the larger block size associated with BCH is that security could be compromised relative to the Bitcoin network. Similarly, bitcoin remains the most popular cryptocurrency in the world as well as the largest by market cap, so users of BCH may find that liquidity and real-world usability is lower than for bitcoin.</p>

                        <li> <h3>Tron (TRX):</h3></li>
						<p>TRON is a Blockchain-based decentralized operating system based on a cryptocurrency native to the system, known as TRX <a href="#[10]">[10]</a>. It aims to build a free, global digital content entertainment system with distributed storage technology, and allows easy and cost-effective sharing of digital content. 
						Tron was founded in September 2017 by a Singapore based non-profit organization called the Tron Foundation. It is headed by CEO Justin Sun and has a dedicated in-house development team that includes renowned technology stalwarts. This article explores the Tron network, its workings, and its cryptocurrency Tronix (TRX).</p>


                        <li> <h3>EOS.IO (EOS) ε:</h3></li>
						<p>EOS <a href="#[11]">[11]</a> is a blockchain-based decentralized operating system that is designed to create, host, and support secure, decentralized autonomous applications (dApps) and smart contracts. In addition, EOS nodes subscribe to a "constitution" that binds them, via the blockchain, to the rules and regulations set forth by the EOS community.
						Currently administered by the block.one organization, EOS was launched by Dan Larimer, who is also the founder and creator of established platforms like Bitshares and Steem.
						As of February 2020, EOS is among the 20 most valuable blockchain tokens by market capitalization. Blockchain-based dApps can be commercial or focused on individual users, and work in a way similar to web-based apps. The EOS platform supports all required features for developing, hosting, and using the dApps, like providing secure access and authentication, permissioning, data hosting, usage management, and communication between the dApps and the Internet.
						No official full form exists for EOS, and the creators have decided not to formally define it themselves. Compared to the web-based apps platform, the EOS offers a lot of advantages.
						Leveraging the scalability potential of blockchain, it is capable of processing large numbers of transactions in parallel. Its ownership structure eliminates transaction charges as users are permitted to utilize resources in proportion to their stake instead of the standard pay-per-transaction model. This also makes it easier for app developers to predict hosting costs.2﻿﻿
						EOS uses delegated proof-of-stake concept, which allows flexibility to make instant high-level decisions, like rollback and bug fixing, through a majority accord among designated stakeholders.</p>
